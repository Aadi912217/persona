My Profile App is built using Flutter with a clean MVC structure and GetX for state management and navigation. The UI follows Material Design guidelines, using widgets such as Scaffold, Column, Row, Card, ListView, and CircleAvatar to create a modern and responsive layout. The Welcome Screen uses a gradient background and a navigation button. The Profile Screen displays the user’s picture, personal details, contact information, and social media links using IconButtons. A floating action button leads to the About Me page, which organizes education, skills, and hobbies using ListView and Chip widgets. Custom colors, padding, and responsive design ensure a professional look across devices. The project follows SOLID principles and includes reusable custom widgets.
